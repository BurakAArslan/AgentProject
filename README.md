# AgentProject
-SMART TRANSPORTATION & TRAFFIC OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
-ReAct + Multi-RAG + Live API Integration

==================================================

This project aims to develop a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) based artificial intelligence agent that integrates traffic safety, traffic regulations, and live traffic data within the scope of smart transportation systems.

The system combines:

PDF-based information retrieval (RAG)

Live traffic APIs (TomTom)

Mathematical reasoning

Tool-forced decision-making mechanisms

to provide an architecture that guarantees the use of the correct tool for the correct type of question.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Prevent hallucinations in traffic-related questions

Automatically switch to live APIs when static knowledge is insufficient

Orchestrate RAG, API, and Math tools in a controlled manner

Make the Thought → Action → Observation reasoning chain fully traceable

Produce measurable success rates for benchmark and demo queries

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

ReAct Workflow:

THOUGHT
→ ACTION
→ OBSERVATION
→ FINAL ANSWER

THOUGHT: The model’s reasoning and decision rationale

ACTION: The selected tool (RAG / API / Math)

OBSERVATION: Raw output returned by the tool

FINAL ANSWER: A justified and verified response

MULTI-RAG STRUCTURE

The system stores multiple PDF-based knowledge sources in separate vector spaces:

SAFETY

Safe Driving Techniques documents

REGULATION

Highway Traffic Regulation

Turkish Highway Traffic Law No. 2918

SIGNS

Traffic Signs Handbook

Note:
The RAG tool does not generate answers; it only retrieves raw contextual information.
All final answers are generated by the agent itself.

INTEGRATED API TOOLS

LIVE TRAFFIC API (TomTom)

Area-based real-time traffic congestion

Traffic flow and congestion percentage

Flow Segment Data usage

Example:
"What is the current traffic congestion in the Esenyurt area?"
→ live_traffic_api is mandatory

MATHEMATICS (Math Tool)

Secure mathematical evaluation

“Half of the speed in meters” rule

No unit conversion is applied

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python 3

Groq LLM API

llama-3.3-70b-versatile

TomTom Traffic & Routing API

TF-IDF-based In-Memory Vector Store

ReAct Agent Orchestration

PDF Processing: pypdf

BENCHMARK SYSTEM

Benchmarks evaluate whether the system uses the correct tool for each question type.

Benchmark Categories:

A) Solvable using RAG only
B) RAG + Math (Multi-hop reasoning)
C) RAG insufficient → Live API required

Measured Metrics:

Was an answer successfully produced (ok)

Were the expected tools actually used

Average number of reasoning steps

Tool accuracy rate (%)

DEMO & SINGLE-QUERY EVALUATION

The benchmark logic is also applied to demo queries.

For each demo question:

Expected tools are inferred automatically

Used tools are compared against expectations

PASS / FAIL status is calculated

Example Output:

--- DEMO SUCCESS METRICS ---
Expected Tool: rag_search
Used Tool: rag_search
Tool Accuracy: True
Step Count: 1
Successful: True

SETUP AND EXECUTION

Required Packages:

pip install groq pypdf requests

Environment Variables:

GROQ_API_KEY=...
TOMTOM_API_KEY=...

Run:

python main.py

PROJECT STRENGTHS

Tool-forced reasoning (answers without tools are disallowed)

Hallucination prevention rules

Fully traceable ReAct reasoning chain

Academic benchmark-compatible design

Real-world live API integration

Conclusion

In this study, the proposed ReAct-based smart transportation system demonstrated a reliable reasoning process by consistently selecting the appropriate tool—RAG, live traffic APIs, or mathematical computation—based on the type of query. Benchmark and demo results indicate that the system provides a suitable solution for real-world intelligent transportation applications due to its high tool-selection accuracy and fully traceable Thought–Action–Observation reasoning chain.
